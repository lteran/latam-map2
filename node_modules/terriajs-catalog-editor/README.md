## TerriaJS Catalog Editor

This is a web-based editor for TerriaJS catalog ("init") files. The editor itself is constructed by passing a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) to [JSON editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor). The schema is generated by [generate-terriajs-schema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-terriajs-schema).
