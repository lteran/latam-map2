If undefined, proxied URLs are effectively cachableforever.  The duration is expressed as a Varnish-like duration string, such as '1d' (one day) or '10000s' (ten thousand seconds).`customProperties`The dictionary of custom item properties.`description`The description of the item.`domainSpecification`A description of a domain that will be pulled from the CSW service and used to define the metadataGroups. The domain is obtained by querying the CSW server for a particular property - the values of the property form the domain, the values are assumed to define a hierarchy eg. Wave Models | Wave Energy Flux - which is a two level hierarchy of groups that will be used to classify metadata records.`forceProxy`Gets or sets whether or not this member should be forced to use a proxy.This property is not observable.`getRecordsTemplate`The template XML string to POST to the CSW server to query for catalog items.  If this property is undefined,CswCatalogGroup.defaultGetRecordsTemplate is used.  The XML string should have a `{startPosition}` placeholder to bereplaced with the next start position in order to allow incremental paging of results.`hideSource`Indicates that the source of this data should be hidden from the UI (obviously this isn't super-secure as youcan just look at the network requests).`id`An optional unique id for this member, that is stable across renames and moves.Use uniqueId to get the canonical unique id for this CatalogMember, which is present even if there is no id.`includeCsv`True to allow CSV resources to be added to the catalog; otherwise, false.`includeEsriMapServer`True to allow ESRI Map resources to be added to the catalog; otherwise, false.`includeGeoJson`True to allow GeoJSON resources to be added to the catalog; otherwise, false.`includeKml`True to allow KML resources to be added to the catalog; otherwise, false.`includeWms`True to allow WMS resources to be added to the catalog; otherwise, false.`includeWps`True to allow OGC:WPS service resources to be added to the catalog; otherwise, false.`info`The array of section titles and contents for display in the layer info panel.In future this may replace 'description' above - this list should not containsections named 'description' or 'Description' if the 'description' propertyis also set as both will be displayed.The object is of the form {name:string, content:string}.Content will be rendered as Markdown with HTML.`infoSectionOrder`The array of section titles definining the display order of info sections.  If this propertyis not defined, DataPreviewSections's DEFAULT_SECTION_ORDER is used.`initialMessage`A message object that is presented to the user when an item or group is initially clickedThe object is of the form {title:string, content:string, key: string, confirmation: boolean, confirmText: string, width: number, height: number}.`isHidden`A value indicating whether this item is hidden from the catalog.  Thisproperty is observable.`isOpen`A value indicating whether the group is currently expanded and showingits children.`isPromoted`A value indicating whether this item is kept above other non-promoted items.`isUserSupplied`A value indicating whether this member was supplied by the user rather than loaded from one of theTerria's initSources.  User-supplied members must be serialized completely when, for example,serializing enabled members for sharing.`isWaitingForDisclaimer`Whether this catalog member is waiting for a disclaimer to be accepted before showing itself.`itemProperties`A hash of properties that will be set on the item created from the CKAN resource.For example, { "treat404AsError": false }`name`The name of the item.`nameInCatalog`The name of this catalog member in the catalog. By default this is just `name`, but can be overridden.`shareKeys`An array of all possible keys that can be used to match to this catalog member when specified in a share link -used for maintaining backwards compatibility when adding or changing CatalogMember's id.`shortReport`A short report to show on the now viewing tab.`url`The URL of the CSW server.
