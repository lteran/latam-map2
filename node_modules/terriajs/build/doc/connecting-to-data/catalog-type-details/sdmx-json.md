!!! note    This page is automatically generated from the source code, and is a bit rough.  If you have    trouble, check the [source code for this type](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/blob/master/lib/Models/SdmxJsonCatalogItem.js) or post a message to the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/terriajs).A CatalogItem representing region-mapped data obtained from SDMX-JSON format.Descriptions of this format are available at:- https://data.oecd.org/api/sdmx-json-documentation/- https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-json/tree/master/data-message/docs- https://sdmx.org/- http://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/ (hosts a handy query builder)The URL can be of two types, eg:1. http://example.com/sdmx-json/data/DATASETID/BD1+BD2.LGA.1+2.A/all?startTime=2013&endTime=20132. http://example.com/sdmx-json/data/DATASETIDFor #2, the dimension names and codes come from (in json format):http://example.com/sdmx-json/dataflow/DATASETID## [Initialization File](../../customizing/initialization-files.md) properties:`"type": "sdmx-json"``aggregatedDimensionIds`An array of dimension ids whose values should not be shown in the Now Viewing panel;instead, their values should be aggregated and treated as a single value.Eg. useful if a dimension is repeated (eg. STATE and REGION).NOTE: Currently only a single aggregatedDimensionId is supported.This should not be applied to regions or time periods.`blacklist`Gets or sets each dimension's non-allowed values, by id. Eg. {"COB": ["TOTAL", "1"], "FREQUENCY": ["Q"]}.If not defined, all values are allowed (subject to the whitelist).If a dimension is not present, all values for that dimension are allowed (subject to the whitelist).Note this will not be applied to regions or time periods.If the same value is in both the whitelist and the blacklist, the blacklist wins.The expression is first matched as a regular expression (sandwiched between ^ and &);if that fails, it is matched as a literal string.  So eg. "[0-9]+" will match 015 but not A015.`cacheDuration`The cache duration to use for proxied URLs for this catalog member.  If undefined, proxied URLs are effectively cachableforever.  The duration is expressed as a Varnish-like duration string, such as '1d' (one day) or '10000s' (ten thousand seconds).`canDisplayPercent`Gets or sets whether this item can show percentages instead of raw values.This is set to true automatically if total value ids are available on all necessary columns.`canUseOwnClock`A flag indicating whether it can ever be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier),instead of the terria clock.If this is true, the catalog item should define this.intervals and a gettable property this.availableDates.Default false.`cleanFootnotes`Gets or sets whether to remove trailing "(x)"s from the values that appear in the SDMX-JSON response.If true, for example, "Total responses(c)" would be replaced with "Total responses".This is a workaround for an ABS-specific issue.Default false.`colors`The array of color strings used for chart lines.TODO: make this customizable, eg. use colormap / colorPalette.`customProperties`The dictionary of custom item properties.`data`The data, represented as a binary Blob, a string, or a Promise for one of those things.If this property is set, CatalogItem's url is ignored.`dataCustodian`A description of the custodian of this data item.This property is an HTML string that must be sanitized before display to the user.`dataSourceUrl`The URL from which the TableCatalogItem's data was obtained.  This is informational; it is notused.  This propery is observable.`dataUrl`The URL from which this data item's raw data can be retrieved, or undefined if raw data forthis data item is not available.`dataUrlComponent`The 'data' SDMX URL component, eg. 'data' in http://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/QNA.Defaults to 'data'.`dataUrlType`The type of the CatalogItem's dataUrl, or undefined if raw data for this datasource is not available.Valid values are: * `direct` - A direct link to the data. * `wfs` - A Web Feature Service (WFS) base URL.  If CatalogItem's dataUrl is not           specified, the base URL will be this data item's URL. * `wfs-complete` - A complete, ready-to-use link to download features from a WFS server. * `none` - There is no data link.`dataflowUrlComponent`The 'dataflow' SDMX URL component, eg. 'dataflow' in http://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/dataflow/QNA.Defaults to 'dataflow'.`dateFormat`Options for formatting current time and timeline tic labels. Options are:   currentTime   // Current time in time slider will be shown in this format. For example "mmmm yyyy" for Jan 2016.   timelineTic   // Timeline tics will have this label. For example "yyyy" will cause each tic to be labelled with the year.`description`The description of the item.`displayChoicesBeforeLegend`A flag which determines whether the legend comes before (false) or after (true) the display variable choice.Default true.`displayPercent`Gets or sets whether to show percentages or raw values.`endTime`The endTime to use as part of the ?startTime=...&endTime=... query parameters.Currently a string, but could be extended to be an object with frequency codes as keys.By default this is undefined, and not used as part of the query.`featureInfoTemplate`A template to display message in a info box.May be a string or an object with template, name and/or partials properties.`forceProxy`Gets or sets whether or not this member should be forced to use a proxy.This property is not observable.`forceShowDimensionIds`An array of dimension ids which, if present, should be shown to the user, even if there is only one value.This is useful if the name of the dataset doesn't convey what is in it, but one of the dimension values does. Eg. ['MEASURE'].Default [].`frequencyDimensionId`The SDMX frequency dimension id. Defaults to 'FREQUENCY'.`hideSource`Indicates that the source of this data should be hidden from the UI (obviously this isn't super-secure as youcan just look at the network requests).`id`An optional unique id for this member, that is stable across renames and moves.Use uniqueId to get the canonical unique id for this CatalogMember, which is present even if there is no id.`idColumns`The column identifiers (names or indices), so we can identify individual featureswithin a table with a time column, or across multiple polled lat/lon files.Eg. ['lat', 'lon'] for immobile features, or ['identifier'] if a unique identifier is provided(where these are column names in the table; column numbers work as well).For region-mapped files, the region identifier is used instead.For non-spatial files, the x-column is used instead.`info`The array of section titles and contents for display in the layer info panel.In future this may replace 'description' above - this list should not containsections named 'description' or 'Description' if the 'description' propertyis also set as both will be displayed.The object is of the form {name:string, content:string}.Content will be rendered as Markdown with HTML.`infoSectionOrder`The array of section titles definining the display order of info sections.  If this propertyis not defined, DataPreviewSections's DEFAULT_SECTION_ORDER is used.`initialMessage`A message object that is presented to the user when an item or group is initially clickedThe object is of the form {title:string, content:string, key: string, confirmation: boolean, confirmText: string, width: number, height: number}.`isEnabled`A value indicating whether this data item is enabled.  An enabled data item appears in the"Now Viewing" pane, but is not necessarily shown on the map.`isHidden`A value indicating whether this item is hidden from the catalog.  Thisproperty is observable.`isLegendVisible`A value indicating whether the legend for this data item is currently visible.`isLoading`A value indicating whether this data source is currently loading.`isMappable`A value indicating whether this data source is mappable.`isPromoted`A value indicating whether this item is kept above other non-promoted items.`isSampled`A value indicating whether the rows correspond to "sampled" data.This only makes a difference if there is a time column and idColumns.In this case, if isSampled is true, then feature position, color and size are interpolatedto produce smooth animation of the features over time.If isSampled is false, then times are treated as the start of periods, so thatfeature positions, color and size are kept constant from one time until the next,then change suddenly.Color and size are never interpolated when they are drawn from a text column.`isShown`A value indicating whether this data item is currently shown on the map.  In order to be shown,the item must also be enabled.`isUserSupplied`A value indicating whether this member was supplied by the user rather than loaded from one of theTerria's initSources.  User-supplied members must be serialized completely when, for example,serializing enabled members for sharing.`isWaitingForDisclaimer`Whether this catalog member is waiting for a disclaimer to be accepted before showing itself.`keepOnTop`Keeps the layer on top of all other imagery layers.`legendUrl`The URL of the legend to show when this catalog item is enabled.  If there is more than onelegend URL, this property returns the first one.`legendUrls`The URLs of the legends to show when this catalog item is enabled.`maximumShownFeatureInfos`The maximum number of features whose information can be shown at one time in the Feature Info Panel, from this item.Defaults to terria.configParameters.defaultMaximumShownFeatureInfos`metadataUrl`The URL from which this data item's metadata description can be retrieved, or undefined ifmetadata is not available for this data item.  The format of the metadata depends on the type of data item.For example, Web Map Service (WMS) data items provide their metadata via their GetCapabilities document.`name`The name of the item.`nameInCatalog`The name of this catalog member in the catalog. By default this is just `name`, but can be overridden.`nowViewingMessage`A message to show when this item is enabled for the first time in order to call attention to the Now Viewing panel.`opacity`The opacity (alpha) of the data item, where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 isfully opaque.`providerId`The provider id in the SDMX URL, eg. the final 'all' in http://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/QNA/.../all.Defaults to 'all'.`rectangle`The geographic rectangle (extent or bounding box) containing this data item.`regionDimensionId`The SDMX region dimension id, which is not displayed as a user-choosable dimension. Defaults to 'REGION'.`regionNameTemplate`A Mustache template used to turn the name of the region provided in the "regionType" variableinto a csv-geo-au-compliant column name. The Mustache variable "{{name}}" holds the original name.You can use this to specify a year in the name, even if it is absent on the server.Eg. "{{name}}_code_2016" converts STE to STE_code_2016.By default this is undefined. If it is undefined, the following rules are applied:  - If there's a _, replace the last one with _code_; else append _code. So SA4 -> SA4_code; SA4_2011 -> SA4_code_2011.  - If the name ends in 4 digits without an underscore, insert "_code_", eg. LGA2011 -> LGA_code_2011.`regionType`The regiontype directly, which is an alternative to including a regiontype in the data.Eg. "cnt3" would tell us that we should use cnt3 as the table column name.By default this is undefined.`regionTypeDimensionId`The SDMX region-type dimension id used with the region code to set the region type.Usually defaults to 'REGIONTYPE'.`selectedInitially`The concepts which are initially selected, eg. {"MEASURE": ["GDP", "GNP"], "FREQUENCY": ["A"]}.Defaults to the first value in each dimension (when undefined).`shareKeys`An array of all possible keys that can be used to match to this catalog member when specified in a share link -used for maintaining backwards compatibility when adding or changing CatalogMember's id.`shortReport`A short report to show on the now viewing tab.`showWarnings`Should any warnings like failures in region mapping be displayed to the user?`showsInfo`A value indicating whether this data source should show an info icon.`singleValuedDimensionIds`The dimensions for which you can only select a single value at a time.The frequency and regiontype dimensions are added to this list in allSingleValuedDimensionIds.`sortValues`Gets or sets how to re-sort the values that appear in the SDMX-JSON response, in the Now Viewing panel.The default is null, so that the order is maintained (except for totalValueIds, which are moved to the top).By setting this to 'name' or 'id', the values are sorted into alphabetical and/or numerical order either by name or by id,respectively.`startTime`The startTime to use as part of the ?startTime=...&endTime=... query parameters.Currently a string, but could be extended to be an object with frequency codes as keys.By default this is undefined, and not used as part of the query.`timePeriodDimensionId`The SDMX time period dimension id, which is not displayed as a user-choosable dimension. Defaults to 'TIME_PERIOD'.`totalValueIds`Gets or sets value ids for each dimension which correspond to total values.Place the grand total first.If all dimensions (except region-type, region and frequency) have totalsavailable, then a "Display as a percentage of regional total" option becomes available.Eg. Suppose AGE had "10" for 10 year olds, etc, plus "ALL" for all ages, "U21" and "21PLUS" for under and over 21 year olds.Then you would want to specify {"AGE": ["ALL", "U21", "21PLUS"]}.In this case, when the user selects one of these values, any other values will be unselected.And when the user selects any other value (eg. "10"), if any of these values were selected, they will be unselected.In addition, any values provided under a wildcard "*" key are used for _all_ dimensions, and are shown first in the list,if present, eg. {"*": ["ALL"], "AGE": ["U21", "21PLUS"]}.`url`The URL of this data.`useOwnClock`A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier),or, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false.`whitelist`Gets or sets each dimension's allowed values, by id. Eg. {"SUBJECT": ["GDP", "GNP"], "FREQUENCY": ["A"]}.If not defined, all values are allowed.If a dimension is not present, all values for that dimension are allowed.Note this will not be applied to regions or time periods.The expression is first matched as a regular expression (sandwiched between ^ and &);if that fails, it is matched as a literal string.  So eg. "[0-9]+" will match 015 but not A015.`zoomOnEnable`A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled.Note that within a single init source:* Catalog items with both `isEnabled` and `zoomOnEnable` set to true will override the top-level `initialCamera` property.* If multiple catalog items have both `isEnabled` and `zoomOnEnable` set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera.In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the _last_ init source, whetherit is a result of a `zoomOnEnable` or an `initialCamera`,
