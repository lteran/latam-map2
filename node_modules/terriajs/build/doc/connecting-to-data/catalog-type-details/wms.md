If undefined, this property is automatically populated from the WMS GetCapabilities on load.This property is an object that has a property named for each layer.  The value of the property is an arrayof dimensions available for this layer.  A dimension has the fields shown in the example below.  See theWMS 1.3.0 specification, section C.2, for a description of the fields.  All fields are optional except`name` and `options`.`availableStyles`The available styles for each selected layer in WebMapServiceCatalogItem's layers.  If undefined,this property is automatically populated from the WMS GetCapabilities on load.  This property is an object that has aproperty named for each layer.  The value of the property is an array where each element in the array is a style supportedby the layer.  The style has `name`, `title`, `abstract`, and `legendUrl` properties.`cacheDuration`The cache duration to use for proxied URLs for this catalog member.  If undefined, proxied URLs are effectively cachableforever.  The duration is expressed as a Varnish-like duration string, such as '1d' (one day) or '10000s' (ten thousand seconds).`canUseOwnClock`A flag indicating whether imagery _can_ be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier).For this catalog type, default True.`clipToRectangle`A value indicating whether this dataset should be clipped to the CatalogItem's rectangle.If true, no part of the dataset will be displayed outside the rectangle.  This property is true by default,leading to better performance and avoiding tile request errors that might occur when requesting tiles outside theserver-specified rectangle.  However, it may also cause features to be cut off in some cases, such as if a serverreports an extent that does not take into account that the representation of features sometimes require a largerspatial extent than the features themselves.  For example, if a point feature on the edge of the extent is drawnas a circle with a radius of 5 pixels, half of that circle will be cut off.`colorScaleMaximum`The maximum of the color scale range.  Because COLORSCALERANGE is a non-standardproperty supported by ncWMS servers, this property is ignored unless WebMapServiceCatalogItem's supportsColorScaleRangeis true.  WebMapServiceCatalogItem's colorScaleMinimum must be set as well.`colorScaleMinimum`The minumum of the color scale range.  Because COLORSCALERANGE is a non-standardproperty supported by ncWMS servers, this property is ignored unless WebMapServiceCatalogItem's supportsColorScaleRangeis true.  WebMapServiceCatalogItem's colorScaleMaximum must be set as well.`customProperties`The dictionary of custom item properties.`dataCustodian`A description of the custodian of this data item.This property is an HTML string that must be sanitized before display to the user.`dataUrl`The URL from which this data item's raw data can be retrieved, or undefined if raw data forthis data item is not available.`dataUrlType`The type of the CatalogItem's dataUrl, or undefined if raw data for this datasource is not available.Valid values are: * `direct` - A direct link to the data. * `wfs` - A Web Feature Service (WFS) base URL.  If CatalogItem's dataUrl is not           specified, the base URL will be this data item's URL. * `wfs-complete` - A complete, ready-to-use link to download features from a WFS server. * `none` - There is no data link.`dateFormat`Options for formatting current time and timeline tic labels. Options are:   currentTime   // Current time in time slider will be shown in this format. For example "mmmm yyyy" for Jan 2016.   timelineTic   // Timeline tics will have this label. For example "yyyy" will cause each tic to be labelled with the year.`description`The description of the item.`dimensions`The selected values for dimensions available for this WMS layer.  The value of this property isan object where each key is the name of a dimension and each value is the value to use for that dimension.Note that WMS does not allow dimensions to be explicitly specified per layer.  So the selected dimension values areapplied to all layers with a corresponding dimension.`disableUserChanges`A value indicating whether the user's ability to change the display properties of thiscatalog item is disabled.  For example, if true, WebMapServiceCatalogItem's styles should not bechangeable through the user interface.`displayChoicesBeforeLegend`A flag which determines whether the legend comes before (false) or after (true) the display variable choice.Default false.`displayDuration`Gets or sets how many seconds time-series data with a start date but no end date should last, in seconds.`featureInfoTemplate`A template to display message in a info box.May be a string or an object with template, name and/or partials properties.`forceProxy`Gets or sets whether or not this member should be forced to use a proxy.This property is not observable.`getFeatureInfoFormats`The formats in which to try WMS GetFeatureInfo requests.  If this property is undefined, the `WebMapServiceImageryProvider` defaultsare used.`hideSource`Indicates that the source of this data should be hidden from the UI (obviously this isn't super-secure as youcan just look at the network requests).`id`An optional unique id for this member, that is stable across renames and moves.Use uniqueId to get the canonical unique id for this CatalogMember, which is present even if there is no id.`ignoreUnknownTileErrors`A value indicating whether non-specific (no HTTP status code) tile errors should be ignored. This is alast resort, for dealing with odd cases such as data sources that return non-images (eg XML) with a 200 status code.No error messages will be shown to the user.`info`The array of section titles and contents for display in the layer info panel.In future this may replace 'description' above - this list should not containsections named 'description' or 'Description' if the 'description' propertyis also set as both will be displayed.The object is of the form {name:string, content:string}.Content will be rendered as Markdown with HTML.`infoSectionOrder`The array of section titles definining the display order of info sections.  If this propertyis not defined, DataPreviewSections's DEFAULT_SECTION_ORDER is used.`initialMessage`A message object that is presented to the user when an item or group is initially clickedThe object is of the form {title:string, content:string, key: string, confirmation: boolean, confirmText: string, width: number, height: number}.`initialTimeSource`Options for the value of the animation timeline at start. Valid options in config file are:    initialTimeSource: "present"                            // closest to today's date    initialTimeSource: "start"                              // start of time range of animation    initialTimeSource: "end"                                // end of time range of animation    initialTimeSource: An ISO8601 date e.g. "2015-08-08"    // specified date or nearest if date is outside range`isEnabled`A value indicating whether this data item is enabled.  An enabled data item appears in the"Now Viewing" pane, but is not necessarily shown on the map.`isEsri`Gets or sets whether this WMS has been identified as being provided by an Esri ArcGIS MapServer. No assumption is made about where an ArcGIS MapServer endpoint also exists.`isGeoServer`Gets or sets whether this WMS has been identified as being provided by a GeoServer.`isHidden`A value indicating whether this item is hidden from the catalog.  Thisproperty is observable.`isLegendVisible`A value indicating whether the legend for this data item is currently visible.`isLoading`A value indicating whether this data source is currently loading.`isMappable`A value indicating whether this data source is mappable.`isNcWMS`Gets or sets whether this WMS has been identified as being provided by ncWMS.`isPromoted`A value indicating whether this item is kept above other non-promoted items.`isRequiredForRendering`A value indicating whether tiles of this catalog item are required to be loaded before terraintiles to which they're attached can be rendered.  This should usually be set to true for base layers andfalse for all others.`isShown`A value indicating whether this data item is currently shown on the map.  In order to be shown,the item must also be enabled.`isUserSupplied`A value indicating whether this member was supplied by the user rather than loaded from one of theTerria's initSources.  User-supplied members must be serialized completely when, for example,serializing enabled members for sharing.`isWaitingForDisclaimer`Whether this catalog member is waiting for a disclaimer to be accepted before showing itself.`keepOnTop`Keeps the layer on top of all other imagery layers.`layers`The WMS layers to include.  To specify multiple layers, separate themwith a commas.`legendUrl`The URL of the legend to show when this catalog item is enabled.  If there is more than onelegend URL, this property returns the first one.`legendUrls`The URLs of the legends to show when this catalog item is enabled.`maxRefreshIntervals`The maximum number of intervals that can be created by a singledate range, when specified in the form time/time/periodicity.eg. 2015-04-27T16:15:00/2015-04-27T18:45:00/PT15M has 11 intervals`maximumShownFeatureInfos`The maximum number of features whose information can be shown at one time in the Feature Info Panel, from this item.Defaults to terria.configParameters.defaultMaximumShownFeatureInfos`metadataUrl`The URL from which this data item's metadata description can be retrieved, or undefined ifmetadata is not available for this data item.  The format of the metadata depends on the type of data item.For example, Web Map Service (WMS) data items provide their metadata via their GetCapabilities document.`minScaleDenominator`The denominator of the largest scale (smallest denominator) for which tiles should be requested.  For example, if this value is 1000, then tiles representinga scale larger than 1:1000 (i.e. numerically smaller denominator, when zooming in closer) will not be requested.  Instead, tiles of the largest-available scale, as specified by this property,will be used and will simply get blurier as the user zooms in closer.`name`The name of the item.`nameInCatalog`The name of this catalog member in the catalog. By default this is just `name`, but can be overridden.`nowViewingMessage`A message to show when this item is enabled for the first time in order to call attention to the Now Viewing panel.`opacity`The opacity (alpha) of the data item, where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 isfully opaque.`parameters`The additional parameters to pass to the WMS server when requesting images.All parameter names must be entered in lowercase in order to be consistent with references in TerrisJS code.If this property is undefined, WebMapServiceCatalogItem.defaultParameters is used.`populateIntervalsFromTimeDimension`A value indicating whether a time dimension, if it exists in GetCapabilities, should be used to populatethe ImageryLayerCatalogItem's intervals.  If the ImageryLayerCatalogItem's intervals property is set explicitlyon this catalog item, the value of this property is ignored.`rectangle`The geographic rectangle (extent or bounding box) containing this data item.`shareKeys`An array of all possible keys that can be used to match to this catalog member when specified in a share link -used for maintaining backwards compatibility when adding or changing CatalogMember's id.`shortReport`A short report to show on the now viewing tab.`showsInfo`A value indicating whether this data source should show an info icon.`styles`The comma-separated list of styles to request, one per layer list in WebMapServiceCatalogItem's layers.`supportsColorScaleRange`Gets or sets whether this WMS server has been identified as supporting the COLORSCALERANGE parameter.`tilingScheme`The tiling scheme to pass to the WMS server when requesting images.If this property is undefiend, the default tiling scheme of the provider is used.`treat403AsError`A value indicating whether a 403 response code when requesting a tile should betreated as an error.  If false, 403s are assumed to just be missing tiles and need not bereported to the user.`treat404AsError`A value indicating whether a 404 response code when requesting a tile should betreated as an error.  If false, 404s are assumed to just be missing tiles and need not bereported to the user.`url`The URL of this data.`useOwnClock`A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier),or, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false.`zoomOnEnable`A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled.Note that within a single init source:* Catalog items with both `isEnabled` and `zoomOnEnable` set to true will override the top-level `initialCamera` property.* If multiple catalog items have both `isEnabled` and `zoomOnEnable` set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera.In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the _last_ init source, whetherit is a result of a `zoomOnEnable` or an `initialCamera`,
