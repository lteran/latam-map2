By contrast to a WebFeatureServiceCatalogGroup, which creates oneWebFeatureServiceCatalogItem per feature *type* (eg, one item for rivers, one for lakes),this group creates one WebFeatureServiceCatalogItem per *feature* (eg, one item for eachindividual river).## [Initialization File](../../customizing/initialization-files.md) properties:`"type": "wfs-features-group"``blacklist`A hash of names of blacklisted data layers.  A layer that appears in this hashwill not be shown to the user.  In this hash, the keys should be the Title of the layers to blacklist,and the values should be "true".`cacheDuration`The cache duration to use for proxied URLs for this catalog member.  If undefined, proxied URLs are effectively cachableforever.

If this propertyis undefined, all catalog items are added at the top level.`hideSource`Indicates that the source of this data should be hidden from the UI (obviously this isn't super-secure as youcan just look at the network requests).`id`An optional unique id for this member, that is stable across renames and moves.Use uniqueId to get the canonical unique id for this CatalogMember, which is present even if there is no id.`info`The array of section titles and contents for display in the layer info panel.In future this may replace 'description' above - this list should not containsections named 'description' or 'Description' if the 'description' propertyis also set as both will be displayed.The object is of the form {name:string, content:string}.Content will be rendered as Markdown with HTML.`infoSectionOrder`The array of section titles definining the display order of info sections.  If this propertyis not defined, DataPreviewSections's DEFAULT_SECTION_ORDER is used.`initialMessage`A message object that is presented to the user when an item or group is initially clickedThe object is of the form {title:string, content:string, key: string, confirmation: boolean, confirmText: string, width: number, height: number}.`isHidden`A value indicating whether this item is hidden from the catalog.
