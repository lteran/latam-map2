Documentation for the query interface is found here: http://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/r.jsp?api## [Initialization File](../../customizing/initialization-files.md) properties:`"type": "abs-itt"``cacheDuration`The cache duration to use for proxied URLs for this catalog member.  If undefined, proxied URLs are effectively cachableforever.  The duration is expressed as a Varnish-like duration string, such as '1d' (one day) or '10000s' (ten thousand seconds).`canDisplayPercent`Gets or sets whether this item can show percentages instead of raw values.`canUseOwnClock`A flag indicating whether it can ever be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier),instead of the terria clock.If this is true, the catalog item should define this.intervals and a gettable property this.availableDates.Default false.`colors`The array of color strings used for chart lines.TODO: make this customizable, eg. use colormap / colorPalette.`conceptNamesUrl`The URL of a JSON file containing human-readable names of Australian Bureau of Statistics concept codes.`conceptsNotToLoad`The array of concept ids which should not be loaded.Defaults to ['STATE', 'FREQUENCY', and the region concept (which defaults to 'REGION')].`customProperties`The dictionary of custom item properties.`data`The data, represented as a binary Blob, a string, or a Promise for one of those things.If this property is set, CatalogItem's url is ignored.`dataCustodian`A description of the custodian of this data item.This property is an HTML string that must be sanitized before display to the user.`dataSourceUrl`The URL from which the TableCatalogItem's data was obtained.  This is informational; it is notused.  This propery is observable.`dataUrl`The URL from which this data item's raw data can be retrieved, or undefined if raw data forthis data item is not available.`dataUrlType`The type of the CatalogItem's dataUrl, or undefined if raw data for this datasource is not available.Valid values are: * `direct` - A direct link to the data. * `wfs` - A Web Feature Service (WFS) base URL.  If CatalogItem's dataUrl is not           specified, the base URL will be this data item's URL. * `wfs-complete` - A complete, ready-to-use link to download features from a WFS server. * `none` - There is no data link.`datasetId`The ID of the ABS dataset.  You can obtain a list of all datasets by queryinghttp://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/query.jsp?method=GetDatasetList (or equivalent).  This propertyis observable.`dateFormat`Options for formatting current time and timeline tic labels. Options are:   currentTime   // Current time in time slider will be shown in this format. For example "mmmm yyyy" for Jan 2016.   timelineTic   // Timeline tics will have this label. For example "yyyy" will cause each tic to be labelled with the year.`description`The description of the item.`displayChoicesBeforeLegend`A flag which determines whether the legend comes before (false) or after (true) the display variable choice.Default false.`displayPercent`Gets or sets whether to show percentages or raw values.`featureInfoTemplate`A template to display message in a info box.May be a string or an object with template, name and/or partials properties.`filter`Gets the list of initial concepts and codes on which to filter the data.  You can obtain a list of all availableconcepts for a dataset by querying http://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/query.jsp?method=GetDatasetConcepts&datasetid=ABS_CENSUS2011_B25(or equivalent) and a list of the possible values for a concept by queryinghttp://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/query.jsp?method=GetCodeListValue&datasetid=ABS_CENSUS2011_B25&concept=MEASURE&format=json.`forceProxy`Gets or sets whether or not this member should be forced to use a proxy.This property is not observable.`hideSource`Indicates that the source of this data should be hidden from the UI (obviously this isn't super-secure as youcan just look at the network requests).`id`An optional unique id for this member, that is stable across renames and moves.Use uniqueId to get the canonical unique id for this CatalogMember, which is present even if there is no id.`idColumns`The column identifiers (names or indices), so we can identify individual featureswithin a table with a time column, or across multiple polled lat/lon files.Eg. ['lat', 'lon'] for immobile features, or ['identifier'] if a unique identifier is provided(where these are column names in the table; column numbers work as well).For region-mapped files, the region identifier is used instead.For non-spatial files, the x-column is used instead.`info`The array of section titles and contents for display in the layer info panel.In future this may replace 'description' above - this list should not containsections named 'description' or 'Description' if the 'description' propertyis also set as both will be displayed.The object is of the form {name:string, content:string}.Content will be rendered as Markdown with HTML.`infoSectionOrder`The array of section titles definining the display order of info sections.  If this propertyis not defined, DataPreviewSections's DEFAULT_SECTION_ORDER is used.`initialMessage`A message object that is presented to the user when an item or group is initially clickedThe object is of the form {title:string, content:string, key: string, confirmation: boolean, confirmText: string, width: number, height: number}.`isEnabled`A value indicating whether this data item is enabled.  An enabled data item appears in the"Now Viewing" pane, but is not necessarily shown on the map.`isHidden`A value indicating whether this item is hidden from the catalog.  Thisproperty is observable.`isLegendVisible`A value indicating whether the legend for this data item is currently visible.`isLoading`A value indicating whether this data source is currently loading.`isMappable`A value indicating whether this data source is mappable.`isPromoted`A value indicating whether this item is kept above other non-promoted items.`isSampled`A value indicating whether the rows correspond to "sampled" data.This only makes a difference if there is a time column and idColumns.In this case, if isSampled is true, then feature position, color and size are interpolatedto produce smooth animation of the features over time.If isSampled is false, then times are treated as the start of periods, so thatfeature positions, color and size are kept constant from one time until the next,then change suddenly.Color and size are never interpolated when they are drawn from a text column.`isShown`A value indicating whether this data item is currently shown on the map.  In order to be shown,the item must also be enabled.`isUserSupplied`A value indicating whether this member was supplied by the user rather than loaded from one of theTerria's initSources.  User-supplied members must be serialized completely when, for example,serializing enabled members for sharing.`isWaitingForDisclaimer`Whether this catalog member is waiting for a disclaimer to be accepted before showing itself.`keepOnTop`Keeps the layer on top of all other imagery layers.`legendUrl`The URL of the legend to show when this catalog item is enabled.

The format of the metadata depends on the type of data item.For example, Web Map Service (WMS) data items provide their metadata via their GetCapabilities document.`name`The name of the item.`nameInCatalog`The name of this catalog member in the catalog. By default this is just `name`, but can be overridden.`nowViewingMessage`A message to show when this item is enabled for the first time in order to call attention to the Now Viewing panel.`opacity`The opacity (alpha) of the data item, where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 isfully opaque.`rectangle`The geographic rectangle (extent or bounding box) containing this data item.`regionConcept`The ABS region concept id. Defaults to 'REGION'.`regionPopulationsUrlPrefix`The start of a URL of a csv file containing the total number of people in each region, eg.SA4,Tot_P_M,Tot_P_F,Tot_P_P101,100000,23450,123450102,130000,100000,234560The region code and '.csv' are appended to the end of this URL for the request, eg.'data/2011Census_TOT_' -> 'data/2011Census_TOT_SA4.csv' (and other region types).`regionTypeConcept`The ABS region-type concept id used with the region code to set the region type.Usually defaults to 'REGIONTYPE'.`shareKeys`An array of all possible keys that can be used to match to this catalog member when specified in a share link -used for maintaining backwards compatibility when adding or changing CatalogMember's id.`shortReport`A short report to show on the now viewing tab.`showWarnings`Should any warnings like failures in region mapping be displayed to the user?`showsInfo`A value indicating whether this data source should show an info icon.`uniqueValuedConcepts`The array of ids of concepts which are single-valued, in addition to the region type.`url`The URL of this data.`useOwnClock`A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier),or, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false.`zoomOnEnable`A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled.Note that within a single init source:* Catalog items with both `isEnabled` and `zoomOnEnable` set to true will override the top-level `initialCamera` property.* If multiple catalog items have both `isEnabled` and `zoomOnEnable` set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera.In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the _last_ init source, whetherit is a result of a `zoomOnEnable` or an `initialCamera`,
