The [Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS)](http://landsat.usgs.gov/ldcm_vs_previous.php) provides two thermal bands. These sensors both provide improved signal-to-noise (SNR) radiometric performance quantized over a 12-bit dynamic range. (This translates into 4096 potential grey levels in an image compared with only 256 grey levels in previous 8-bit instruments.) Improved signal to noise performance enable better characterization of land cover state and condition. Products are delivered as 16-bit images (scaled to 55,000 grey levels).',

It has been specifically designed to assure very-high-frequency revisit on large areas (every 3 days on average for any mid-latitude region), with precision agriculture and forestry monitoring applications in mind.

The DEIMOS-2 is operated 24/7, with a network of four ground stations which assures a contact every orbit, and therefore the capacity of commanding the satellite and downloading data every 90 minutes.
